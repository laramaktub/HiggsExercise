Inside the module ```sklearn.metrics``` there is a function ```roc_curve()``` that takes the network predictions ```y_pred``` and the ground truth ```y_test``` for the samples of the **test dataset**. The function computes the **TPR** (```tpr```) and the **FPR** (```fpr```) by scanning the possible values of the discriminant cut (```thresholds```) and returns that information contained in ```numpy.array``` objects. An example of the code implementation would be something like:\n",
